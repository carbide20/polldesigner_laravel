Polldesigner plans:
	There is no real nice looking software readily available online for making polls. Most of the top results on google lead to shoddy-looking sites, that require signing up to use. Most are not straightforward enough to start creating polls right away, which turns people away. The only nice-looking option that actually lets you create a poll right away is SurveyNuts, and this still begs you to sign up, and only gives you very limited options when you don't (100 respondants, 10 questions on a poll, all that bullshit). I can beat every other option on looks and usability easily, and only have to beat SurveyNuts on features. 

	Start with simple question polls, and work into more complex types.
